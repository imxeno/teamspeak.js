## About

This library allows you to interact with TeamSpeak's Server Query interface on a decent level of abstraction.

## Warning

The **project** is still under **really heavy development**, which means:

- it is **incomplete**
- it may be **missing** some **key features**
- a lot of the API **may change without any notice**
- its documentation is not ~~perfect~~ even ready

I would advise you **not to use it** in its current state as an engine for your TeamSpeak bot, and just wait for a `v0.1.x` version.
